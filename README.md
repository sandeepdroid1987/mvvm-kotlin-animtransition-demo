# Description 
The goal of the task is to demonstrate clean code architecture for kotlin sample with transition animation

The application is built around the ["Rick and Morty API"](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation). 

## What this includes 
- Object-oriented programming best practices. Followed practices for easy to read, maintain and test.
- Unit tests
- Network request state handling (loading, error etc.)
- Implemented option to filter characters by date
- Shown the character image and some additional information about a character on the list
- On a character details screen show image, some details about the character and its location like name, type, dimensions.
- Handled configuration change e.g. screen rotation

## Scope of Improvement
- Write more UI tests
- Add Deep Link to go directly to character page 
-On the character details screen, add a button to the new screen showing the list of residents. It will be sufficient to show only the name of each resident.
